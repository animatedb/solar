<h2>Heat Pump</h2>
The solar system was installed in August of 2018 and we used local electrical
space heaters for the first two years. This is easy to see on the solar graphs
since the electrical use goes up a lot during the winter.

<h3>Selecting a Heat Pump</h3>
In September of 2020, we purchased a heat pump. A heat pump should be two or
three times more efficient than electrical heaters, especially in a mild climate.
Another advantage is that it can be used as an air conditioner, which we could
use for the few days a year when it is extremely hot.
<p/>
I looked around for quite a while looking at various types of heat pumps. There
are whole house heat pumps, but we mainly want to heat a smaller living space
much of the time. There are some called "Mini Split" heat pumps, but these to
require a bit more work to install like putting some holes in walls, and possibly
working with refrigerant.
<p/>
We finally settled on what is called a "portable" heat pump. These usually require
a window opening, but we didn't have one since they must normally be sliding style windows.
But we do have a fireplace with a cleanout accessible to the outside.

<h3>Fireplace Cleanout</h3>
The fireplace cleanout inside the house looks like the following.

The fireplace cleanout outside the house looks like the following.

<h3>Outside</h3>
The heat pump will be more efficient if it has an easy way to expel air.
For this reason, I made an outside vent that has a large area for air.
The main idea is to keep animals from getting into the house and to
provide an easy access for air to get out of the house.
I found an old screen, and cut it to side for some old wood I had lying around.

Why do we need only one vent to the outdoors from the heat pump?
