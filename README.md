Hopefully helpful information about installing solar for a residence

<h3>Introduction</h3>
First a couple of graphs to as an introduction, then later get into the details. A 3.24 kW grid-tied system with 12 panels was installed on 11-2018. This first graph shows the amount of electricity generated, and the amount used. This is with no electric car and pretty minimal use of other electricity.

This graph shows the amount of surplus electricity. My utility has an annual true-up program, which means the amount you owe or are paid is figured out once per year. The goal generally is to generate the same amount of electricity over the year as you use.
