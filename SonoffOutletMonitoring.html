<h2>Sonoff Outlet Monitoring and Control using Tasmota</h2>
The Sonoff plugs work without installing softare, but they can send information
to places on the internet that don't need the information. So I install open
source software on the plugs.

This describes how to install open source Tasmoto software on the Sonoff S31
control and monitoring plug. The Tasmoto software will communicate to a local
WiFi home router and allow control and viewing electrical information about anything
connected to the plug.

<h3>Setup for Installing Software on Plug</h3>
A USB to RS-232 converter that has 3V/5V output can be used to install the software.
Something like the HiLetGo CP2102 232 485 port converter. It says it is a
six in one USB to UART Serial Interface Module for about 8$ US.
<br><br>
Four jumper wires are needed to connect the converter to the switch.
The wires can be female to female breadboard jumper wires, or jumper wires with
hook clips sometimes called test hook clips.
Jumper wires are sometimes available with the converter. 
<ul>
<li>Set the switches on the USB converter so that switch one is on and two is off.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Switch one is on for USB, and off for TTL</li>
  <li>Switch two is on for RS-485, and off for RS-232</li>
  </ul>
<li>Open the Sonoff S31 plug.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Do NOT plug the Sonoff plug into a 110V outlet while the plug case is open.</li>
   <li>Open the plug by prying off the gray cap with your fingernails.</li>
   <li>Slide the two white rails along the plug to expose the screws.</li>
   <li>Unscrew the three screws.</li>
   <li>The plug prongs should come out of the enclosing case.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Plug the USB cable into the converter, but do NOT plug the USB into a PC yet.</li>
<li>Hook up the RS-232 wires from the converter to the Sonoff plug.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Hook the clips up to the 4 pins nearest to the GND pin all on one side
  of the converter. They should be labelled 3V3, TXD, RXD and GND.</li>
  <li>The converter pin TX should be connected to Sonoff RX and converter
  pin RX should be connected to Sonoff TX. Three of the pads are close to
  one side in the Sonoff plug, and the ground pad is separated by two pads.</li>
  <li>GND to ground and 3V3 on converter to VCC on plug</li>
  </ul>
<li>
  Install esptool on Linux using:
  <pre>sudo apt install esptool</pre>
</li>
<li>Download the Tasmota software tasmota.bin from https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Download/</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installing Software on Plug</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT plug the Sonoff plug into a 110V outlet while loading software. It can
damage the computer, the plug, and the converter.</li>
<li>Set the plug into firmware download mode by grounding pin GPIO00 or hold GPIO 0
  button (plug power button) while applying USB power (plugging in the USB)</li>
<li>Different operating systems may require different commands to download and run
esptool. It may be possible to run esptool without using the extension ".py" and
may not require "python3".</li>
<li>Use the following to check the setup. If periods and underscores appear for a long time,
  something is wrong with the setup.
  <pre>python3 esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash_id</pre>
</li>
<li>Use the following to save the existing software from the switch if desired.
  <pre>python3 esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 read_flash 0x00000 0x100000 s31image.bin</pre>
</li>
<li>Erase the flash on the plug. If you get, "A fatal error occurred: ESP8266 ROM does not support function erase_flash.", then you may have to get a new version of esptool.
  <pre>python3 esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash</pre>
</li>
<li>Write Tasmota software to the plug.
  <pre>python3 esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -fs 1MB -fm dout 0x0 ../Firmware/tasmota.bin</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring Tasmoto WiFi</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reboot plug and power up still using USB, but don't hold GPIO 0 button.</li>
  <li>Use a phone to find the device and connect to the network starting with Tasmota.
   At first the device acts as a WiFi host so it can be seen by the phone.
   The blue LED on the Sonoff plug will be flashing at about a one second rate.
   </li>
  <li>When it is connected, the plug should prompt for the router for where to send
  the monitoring information and should require a router password. This should be
  the normal client (not admin) password. After entering the information, the screen should say,
  "Configuration saved" and "Device will restart in a few seconds".</li>
  <li>After a successful connection, the plug should send information to the router and an
  HTML screen will be available to other devices connected to the router. The Tasmota
  software should no longer be available to the phone.
  </li>
  <li>Once bound to WiFi, it will take quite a few seconds to show that it is
   bound and display the new IP address. If not bound to WiFi, the blue LED keeps
   flashing unless it is bound.	Once bound it flashes 5 times after power up.
  </li>
  <li>Use a browser and connect to the router. It should have a page that will show
   the connected devices. Then find the new Sonoff plug by
   viewing the connected devices. The MAC address is a unique address for every plug and
   will not change. The IP address may change depending on router settings.
  </li>
  <li>As new plugs are configured, new tasmoto-??? devices should show up from the router.
   The router can be used to find the IP address of each device. The IP address can
   then be used to display the HTML page that is presented by the plug.</li>
  <li>To reset the WiFi binding, use the Fast Power Cycle Device Recovery to reset the device.
   Leave off 30 seconds, power on 6 times at less than 10 second rate, power on 7th time.
   https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Device-Recovery/#fast-power-cycle-device-recovery</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuring Tasmota SonOff Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to "Configuration" and "Configure Module"</Li>
<li>Set to "Sonoff S31", device will take some time to reboot, then shows
 screen again with new Sonoff switch measurements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automated Software and Web Control</h3>
There is open source software that can use the Tasmota connections.

<li>To view power on state with web requests. See https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/
<pre>
	http://<ip>/cm?cmnd=PowerOnState	or	http://10.0.0.98/cm?cmnd=PowerOnState
	It returned 3, which means switch relates to last saved state
</pre>
</li>
<li>To set power on with web requests
<pre>
	http://<ip>/cm?cmnd=Power%20On
	http://<ip>/cm?cmnd=PowerOnState%20On	or Off,...
</pre>
</li>
<li>To control plug from phone, connect to the router/main WiFi from the phone.
Use the browser and enter the IP address that
was assigned (If DHCP) to the plug by the router.
</li>
</ul>
